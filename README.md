What You Can Do Here:

Share Your Projects: Upload your personal coding projects, assignments, and side-projects. Share your knowledge and accomplishments with your peers.

Collaborate: Find like-minded students interested in similar technologies or topics. Collaborate on coding projects, brainstorm ideas, and bring them to life.

Learn Together: Discover new programming languages, frameworks, and libraries. Seek help from the community when you're stuck and offer your expertise to others.

Contribute to Open Source: Explore open-source projects, contribute code, and become part of the global developer community.

Guidelines:

Respect: Be respectful and considerate of others' work and opinions. Constructive feedback is encouraged, but keep it polite and positive.

No Spam: Avoid spamming the repository with irrelevant content or advertisements.

Stay Safe: Protect your personal information. Be cautious about sharing sensitive data and follow best practices for online safety.

File Name: Save code with relevant file name so that other can find the file they want.
